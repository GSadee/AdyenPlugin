# Online Payment Choices - YES

## Why This Is Supported

The plugin excels at providing comprehensive online payment choices because it leverages Adyen's extensive payment method ecosystem and implements flexible filtering capabilities:

### Technical Implementation Details:

1. **Dynamic Payment Method Loading**: The plugin uses Adyen's `/paymentMethods` API to dynamically retrieve all available payment options based on:
   - Merchant configuration and agreements
   - Transaction amount and currency
   - Customer location and country
   - Device capabilities (mobile wallets)

2. **Comprehensive Method Support**: Covers the full spectrum of online payment choices:
   - **Card Payments**: All major credit/debit cards, co-branded cards, corporate cards
   - **Digital Wallets**: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, PayPal, WeChat Pay, AliPay
   - **Bank Transfers**: iDeal (Netherlands), SEPA, Sofort, Bancontact, Giropay
   - **Buy Now Pay Later**: Klarna, Afterpay, installment options
   - **Regional Methods**: Bizum (Spain), Blik (Poland), MB WAY (Portugal), Twint (Switzerland)

3. **Intelligent Filtering**: `PaymentMethodsFilter` allows merchants to:
   - Whitelist specific payment methods for their business model
   - Blacklist methods not suitable for their products
   - Configure region-specific payment options
   - Customize based on order value or customer segments

4. **Drop-in Integration**: Adyen's Web Drop-in component automatically presents all available methods with:
   - Native UI components for each payment type
   - Localized payment method names and instructions
   - Automatic method prioritization based on customer preferences
   - Real-time availability checking

### Why Online Payment Choices Work Excellently Here:

- **Customer Preference Diversity**: Different customers prefer different payment methods based on region, age, device, and trust factors - comprehensive choice increases conversion rates.

- **Geographic Optimization**: Payment method availability varies significantly by country - dynamic loading ensures customers always see relevant options.

- **Device-Specific Options**: Mobile wallets appear only on compatible devices, while bank transfers may be prioritized on desktop.

- **Business Model Flexibility**: Merchants can optimize payment choices for their specific products, customer base, and risk tolerance.

### Benefits for Merchants:

- **Global Expansion**: Easy addition of new markets by enabling region-specific payment methods
- **Risk Management**: Ability to disable high-risk payment methods for certain products or customer segments
