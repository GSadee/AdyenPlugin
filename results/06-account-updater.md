# Account Updater - NO

## Why This Is NOT Supported

The plugin lacks Adyen Account Updater integration because it's a specialized Adyen service that requires specific configuration and optional webhook handling, rather than complex custom infrastructure:

### What Adyen Account Updater Actually Is:

According to Adyen's official documentation, Account Updater is **not a complex custom implementation** but an **Adyen-provided service** with two options:

1. **Real Time Account Updater** (Recommended):
   - **Integration-free**: Automatically checks for updates during payment processing
   - **Automatic Updates**: Immediately retries payments with updated card details
   - **Token Updates**: Automatically updates tokenized card information
   - **Zero Custom Code**: Requires only service enablement in Adyen dashboard

2. **Batch Account Updater** (Advanced Control):
   - **Asynchronous Process**: Merchants control which cards to update and when
   - **File-based**: Send batch request files and process result files
   - **More Control**: Determine timing and scope of updates

### Excellent Foundation for Integration:

The plugin has outstanding infrastructure that supports Account Updater integration:

1. **Token Management System**:
   - `AdyenToken` entity already stores customer payment tokens with relationships
   - `AdyenClient::removeStoredToken()` demonstrates token lifecycle management
   - Integration with `Adyen\Service\Recurring` for token operations
   - Customer-token linking already established

2. **Webhook Infrastructure** (For Batch Mode):
   - Comprehensive webhook handling via `ProcessNotificationsAction.php`
   - `NotificationToCommandResolver` system for processing events
   - HMAC signature validation already implemented
   - Could handle account updater result notifications

3. **Command/Handler Architecture**:
   - Existing token handlers (`CreateTokenHandler`, `GetTokenHandler`)
   - Could add token update handlers following existing patterns
   - Background processing capability through Symfony Messenger

### Implementation Requirements:

**Real Time Account Updater (Simplest):**
1. **Service Enablement**: Enable Real Time Account Updater in Adyen dashboard
2. **Zero Code Changes**: Automatic updates handled by Adyen during payment processing
3. **Optional Logging**: Extend logging to track automatic updates

**Batch Account Updater (Advanced):**
1. **API Integration**: Add batch file upload/download capability to `AdyenClient`
2. **File Processing**: Handle batch request and result file processing
3. **Token Update Logic**: Process batch results and update stored tokens
4. **Optional Webhooks**: Handle batch completion notifications

### Business Context and Value:

- **Adyen Service**: Account Updater is an Adyen-provided service, not a custom feature to build
- **Real Time Option**: Zero-code integration option available for automatic updates
- **Growing E-commerce Value**: Increasingly valuable for stores with saved payment methods
- **Reduced Payment Failures**: Automatic updates prevent failures from expired/replaced cards

### Why Integration Makes Sense:

- **Minimal Development Effort**: Real Time option requires zero code changes
- **Strong Foundation**: Plugin's token management perfectly suited for Account Updater
- **Customer Value**: Seamless updates improve payment success rates
- **Batch Control**: Advanced merchants can use Batch mode for precise control

### Simple Integration Options:

**Option 1: Real Time Account Updater (Recommended)**
- **Zero Code**: Enable service in Adyen dashboard
- **Automatic**: Updates happen during payment processing
- **Transparent**: No additional development required

**Option 2: Batch Account Updater (Advanced)**
- **API Extension**: Add batch processing to existing `AdyenClient`
- **File Processing**: Handle batch request/result files
- **Token Updates**: Process results and update stored tokens
- **Control**: Merchants decide which cards to update and when

### Key Insight:

This is **not about building token update infrastructure** but about **enabling Adyen's Account Updater service**. The complexity varies by option:

**Real Time**: Virtually zero complexity - just service enablement  
**Batch Mode**: Low complexity - file processing and token updates using existing patterns

### Current Alternative Approaches Available:

- **Manual Updates**: Customers can update stored payment methods through account management
- **Checkout Retry**: Failed payments prompt customers to enter new card details
- **Adyen Dashboard**: Manual token management through Adyen's merchant interface

### Use Cases That Would Be Covered:

**Real Time Account Updater:**
- Automatic token updates during payment processing
- Seamless customer experience with zero interruption  
- Reduced payment failures from expired/replaced cards
- Transparent updates with no customer action required

**Batch Account Updater:**
- Controlled token updates on merchant schedule
- Bulk processing of token updates
- Detailed update reporting and audit trails
- Custom update timing and filtering

### Use Cases Still Not Covered:
- Custom update logic beyond Adyen's service
- Multi-processor token synchronization
- Advanced customer notification preferences
- Custom token update validation rules

### Technical Implementation:

**Real Time Account Updater:**
- **Required Changes**: Enable service in Adyen dashboard
- **Code Changes**: None required
- **Estimated Effort**: 0-2 hours (service configuration only)

**Batch Account Updater:**
- **Required Changes**: Add batch processing API integration
- **Code Changes**: File processing, token updates, optional webhooks
- **Estimated Effort**: 40-60 hours

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED (but easily integrated with existing infrastructure)
**Coverage:** Excellent technical foundation exists, with Real Time option requiring zero code changes
