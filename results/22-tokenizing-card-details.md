# Tokenizing Card Details - YES

## Why This IS Supported

The plugin provides comprehensive integration with Adyen's Tokenization service, implementing all core features for secure card detail storage and enabling faster checkout experiences:

### What IS Supported (Adyen Tokenization Integration):

1. **Complete Adyen Tokenization Implementation**:
   - **Secure Token Storage**: Integration with Adyen's tokenization service for encrypted payment detail storage
   - **Shopper Reference Management**: Unique shopper references for each customer token
   - **Merchant Account Scoped**: Tokens properly scoped to specific merchant accounts
   - **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support for cards, ACH, SEPA Direct Debit tokenization

2. **Frontend Tokenization Integration**:
   - **Drop-in Configuration**: `dropin.js:118` - `enableStoreDetails: configuration.canBeStored` enables tokenization consent
   - **Customer Consent**: Explicit opt-in checkbox for payment method storage
   - **Seamless UX**: Transparent integration with Adyen's drop-in component
   - **Security Display**: Masked card information with secure token usage

3. **Backend Token Processing**:
   - **Command Architecture**: `CreateToken` command (`src/Bus/Command/CreateToken.php`) encapsulates tokenization requests
   - **Handler Implementation**: `CreateTokenHandler.php:37-47` processes token creation through factory pattern
   - **Token Factory**: `AdyenTokenFactory` creates token entities with proper customer and payment method relationships
   - **Repository Storage**: Tokens persisted through Sylius resource management

4. **Adyen API Integration**:
   - **Tokenization Requests**: `ClientPayloadFactory.php:317` - `storePaymentMethod = true` sent to Adyen Checkout API
   - **Recurring Processing**: `recurringProcessingModel = 'CardOnFile'` for proper token classification
   - **Token References**: `recurringDetailReference` handling for Adyen token identification
   - **Secure Communication**: All tokenization via Adyen's secure API endpoints

5. **Multiple Tokenization Flows**:
   - **One-off Payments**: Tokenization for future single payments
   - **Subscription Ready**: Token infrastructure supports recurring payments
   - **Automatic Top-ups**: Infrastructure supports automated payment scenarios
   - **Cross-Channel**: Tokens work across different integration touchpoints

### Technical Implementation Excellence:

**Tokenization Creation Flow:**
1. Customer selects "Save payment method" during checkout (`enableStoreDetails`)
2. Payment request includes `storePaymentMethod: true` flag to Adyen
3. Adyen processes payment and creates secure token with `recurringDetailReference`
4. `CreateToken` command dispatched via Symfony Messenger
5. `CreateTokenHandler` creates `AdyenToken` entity linking customer, payment method, and Adyen reference
6. Token stored locally for future retrieval and usage

**Token Usage Flow:**
1. Returning customer checkout displays stored payment methods via Adyen drop-in
2. Customer selects previously saved payment method
3. Payment processed using stored token reference with proper `recurringProcessingModel`
4. No sensitive card details transmitted - only secure token references

**Security Implementation:**
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: No card numbers stored locally - only Adyen's secure token references
- **Customer Authentication**: Token usage requires authenticated customer sessions
- **Merchant Scoped**: Tokens bound to specific merchant accounts
- **Consent Based**: Explicit customer consent required for tokenization

### Adyen Tokenization Service Benefits:

1. **Security and Compliance**:
   - **Reduced PCI Scope**: Drastically reduces PCI DSS compliance requirements
   - **Data Breach Protection**: No sensitive card data stored in merchant systems
   - **Industry Standard**: Adyen's tokenization meets global security standards
   - **Encrypted Storage**: All payment details encrypted within Adyen's secure vault

2. **Customer Experience**:
   - **Faster Checkout**: One-click payments for returning customers
   - **Mobile Optimization**: Critical for mobile commerce where form entry is difficult
   - **Cross-Device**: Tokens work across customer's different devices
   - **Trust Building**: Industry-standard secure storage builds customer confidence

3. **Business Operations**:
   - **Higher Conversion**: Reduced checkout friction increases completion rates
   - **Subscription Enablement**: Foundation for recurring payment business models
   - **Reduced Abandonment**: Eliminates manual card re-entry friction
   - **Customer Retention**: Convenient payment experience encourages repeat business

### Supported Tokenization Scenarios:

**Payment Methods Supported:**
- **Credit/Debit Cards**: All major card brands (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- **Regional Cards**: Local card schemes where supported by Adyen
- **Alternative Methods**: ACH, SEPA Direct Debit tokenization
- **Digital Wallets**: Token-compatible wallet integrations

**Recurring Models Supported:**
- **CardOnFile**: One-click payments for returning customers
- **UnscheduledCardOnFile**: Non-fixed schedule transactions
- **Subscription**: Fixed schedule recurring payments
- **ContAuth**: Continuous authority for variable amounts
