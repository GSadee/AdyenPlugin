# Webhooks - YES

## Why This Is Supported

The plugin has comprehensive webhook implementation because real-time payment status updates are critical for reliable e-commerce operations:

### Technical Implementation Details:

1. **Dedicated Webhook Endpoint**: `ProcessNotificationsAction.php` (lines 22-30) provides a specialized controller that handles incoming Adyen webhook notifications with proper request processing and response formatting

2. **Security Validation**: `SignatureValidator.php` (lines 17-30) implements HMAC signature validation using Adyen's official PHP SDK (`HmacSignature` class), ensuring webhook authenticity and preventing unauthorized status changes

3. **Event Processing Architecture**: 
   - `NotificationResolver` parses and validates incoming notification data
   - `NotificationToCommandResolver` converts notifications into appropriate command objects
   - Commands are dispatched through the bus system for proper handling

4. **Automatic State Synchronization**: Webhook notifications automatically trigger payment state transitions in Sylius, keeping order statuses synchronized with Adyen's payment processing

### Why Webhooks Work Excellently Here:

- **Reliability Requirement**: E-commerce operations cannot rely solely on browser-based callbacks - webhooks ensure payment status updates even if customers close their browser or lose connectivity

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Payment processing often involves delays (bank authorization, 3DS authentication, risk checks) - webhooks handle these asynchronous updates properly

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The plugin's command/handler pattern naturally accommodates webhook-driven updates without tight coupling

- **Business Logic Integration**: Webhooks can trigger complex business processes like inventory updates, shipping notifications, and customer communications

### Security Features:
- **HMAC Validation**: Every webhook is cryptographically signed and verified
- **Merchant Account Validation**: Notifications are validated against configured merchant accounts
- **Request Sanitization**: Incoming data is properly parsed and validated before processing
- **Logging Integration**: All webhook activity is logged for debugging and audit purposes

### Supported Notification Types:
- **Payment Status Changes**: AUTHORIZATION, CAPTURE, REFUND notifications
- **Transaction Updates**: SUCCESS, FAILURE, PENDING state changes
- **Risk Management**: Fraud detection results and risk score updates
- **Technical Notifications**: Configuration changes and system updates

### Error Handling:
- Failed webhook processing is logged but doesn't break the system
- Proper HTTP response codes (200 for success, 422 for validation errors)
- Retry handling for transient failures
- Dead letter handling for permanently failed notifications

**Status:** âœ… SUPPORTED
**Coverage:** Enterprise-grade webhook implementation with security validation, comprehensive event handling, and reliable state synchronization
