## Gap Analysis: Missing Product and Cart Page Express Checkout

### **Current Implementation:**
The plugin currently implements express checkout **only during the traditional checkout process**, not on product or cart pages as described in Adyen's Express Checkout service.

### **What's Currently Supported:**
- **Checkout Page Express**: Apple Pay/Google Pay buttons appear during standard Sylius checkout flow
- **Express Payment Methods**: Fast wallet payments within existing checkout process
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Complete Adyen integration for express payment processing

### **What's Missing for Complete Express Checkout:**
- **Product Page Express**: No "Buy Now with Apple Pay" buttons on product listings
- **Cart Page Express**: No express checkout options in shopping cart
- **Direct Purchase Flows**: No bypass of traditional Sylius checkout steps

### **Implementation Requirements for Complete Express Checkout:**

**Missing Functionality:**
1. **Product Page Integration**: Express checkout buttons and direct-to-payment flows from product pages
2. **Cart Page Integration**: Express checkout options for shopping cart contents
3. **Checkout Bypass Logic**: Order creation without traditional checkout step navigation
4. **Express Order Processing**: Unified backend service for express purchases from any context

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 110-160 hours (2.75-4 weeks for 1 developer)

This includes:
- Shared backend infrastructure for express checkout from any context
- Product page express checkout frontend integration
- Cart page express checkout frontend integration
- Configuration, testing, and production readiness

### Why Current Implementation Is Excellent Foundation:

- **Complete Integration**: Full integration with Adyen's Express Checkout payment methods and APIs
- **Backend Ready**: All payment processing infrastructure exists for express checkout expansion
- **Security Integrated**: Express payments benefit from existing tokenization and fraud protection
- **Adyen Service Compatible**: Current implementation follows Adyen's express checkout patterns

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUPPORT**
**Coverage:** Complete integration with Adyen's Express Checkout payment methods during checkout process, but missing product and cart page express checkout flows that enable true one-click purchases from product listings and shopping cart
