# Token Management - YES

## Why This IS Supported

The plugin provides comprehensive integration with Adyen's Token Management service through complete token lifecycle operations, meeting all requirements for stored payment method management and recurring payments:

## Current Implementation Analysis

### What IS Fully Supported (Adyen Token Management Integration):

1. **Complete Token Lifecycle Operations**:
   - **Token Storage**: `ClientPayloadFactory.php:317` - `storePaymentMethod = true` creates tokens via Adyen Checkout API
   - **Token Usage**: Full support for using stored payment methods for one-click payments
   - **Token Deletion**: `AdyenClient.php:145` - `removeStoredToken()` calls Adyen's Recurring API disable method
   - **Token Listing**: Integration with stored payment methods display in checkout

2. **Adyen Recurring Processing Models**:
   - **CardOnFile Model**: `ClientPayloadFactory.php:320` - `recurringProcessingModel = 'CardOnFile'` for one-click payments
   - **Shopper Interaction**: Proper `shopperInteraction = 'Ecommerce'` for customer-initiated payments
   - **Token References**: Complete integration with Adyen's shopper reference system

3. **Advanced Token Entity Management**:
   - **AdyenToken Entity**: Complete token storage with customer linking (`src/Entity/AdyenToken.php`)
   - **Customer Association**: Tokens linked to Sylius customers via shopper references
   - **Payment Method Binding**: Tokens associated with specific payment method configurations

4. **Frontend Token Management Integration**:
   - **Drop-in Integration**: `dropin.js:96` - `disableStoredPaymentMethodHandler` for customer token removal
   - **Stored Payment Display**: Automatic display of saved payment methods in checkout
   - **Token Removal UI**: Customer-facing interface for managing stored payment methods during checkout

5. **Backend Infrastructure Ready for Account Management**:
   - **Complete API Endpoints**: `RemoveStoredTokenAction.php` with full security validation
   - **Secure Routes**: `bitbag_adyen_remove_token` with authentication and authorization
   - **Repository Methods**: Secure token lookup and management capabilities

## Token Management Capabilities

### **Current Token Operations:**

1. **Token Creation**: Automatic during checkout with customer consent
2. **Token Usage**: One-click payments for returning customers
3. **Token Removal**: Available during checkout via Adyen drop-in interface

### **Supported Recurring Models:**
- **CardOnFile**: One-click payments for returning customers
- **Subscription Ready**: Token infrastructure supports recurring payments
- **Customer-Initiated**: All token usage properly marked as customer-initiated

## Gap Analysis: Missing Account Management Interface

### **Current Limitation:**
Customers can **only manage tokens during checkout** via the Adyen drop-in component. There is **no dedicated account management interface** for viewing, modifying, or deleting saved payment methods outside of the checkout process.

### **What's Missing:**
1. **Customer Account Integration**: No "My Payment Methods" page in customer account area
2. **Token Listing Interface**: No dedicated page to view all saved payment methods
3. **Account-Based Deletion**: No interface to remove tokens from account management
4. **Token Modification**: No capability to update billing addresses or replace expired cards
5. **Token Metadata Display**: No visibility into token creation dates or usage information

## Implementation Requirements for Complete Token Management

### **Phase 1: Basic Account Management**
**Estimated Effort: 40-50 hours (1-1.25 weeks for 1 developer)**

**Token Listing Page (16-20 hours):**
- Create controller and repository methods for customer token listing
- Develop Twig templates showing masked card information and expiry dates
- Integrate with Sylius account navigation and styling

**Enhanced Token Deletion (8-12 hours):**
- AJAX integration with existing `RemoveStoredTokenAction` endpoint
- Confirmation dialogs and user feedback systems
- Real-time UI updates after token removal

**Sylius Integration (16-18 hours):**
- Deep integration with Sylius customer account management
- Security implementation and access controls
- Testing and quality assurance

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
**Estimated Effort: 36-50 hours (0.9-1.25 weeks for 1 developer)**

**Token Modification (24-32 hours):**
- Token replacement workflow (delete old + create new) due to Adyen token immutability
- Edit forms for billing address updates
- Integration with Adyen drop-in for card replacement

**Enhanced Features (12-16 hours):**
- Token metadata display (creation date, last used, billing address)
- Default payment method selection
- Security enhancements and audit logging

## Business Value

### **Customer Experience Benefits:**
- **Complete Control**: Full management of saved payment methods outside checkout
- **Trust Building**: Transparency and control over stored payment information
- **Mobile Optimization**: Dedicated interface better than managing during checkout

### **Merchant Benefits:**
- **Reduced Support**: Customers self-manage payment methods
- **Higher Conversion**: Improved customer confidence and repeat purchases
- **Competitive Advantage**: Matches modern e-commerce platform expectations

## Total Implementation Estimate

**Complete Token Management: 76-100 hours (1.9-2.5 weeks for 1 developer)**

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: 40-50 hours - Essential account-based token management
- **Phase 2 (Complete)**: 36-50 hours - Advanced features and modification capabilities

## Current Status Assessment

**Status:** âœ… **SUPPORTED** (with enhancement opportunity)
**Current Coverage:** Complete Adyen Token Management API integration with checkout-based token management
**Enhancement Opportunity:** Add dedicated customer account interface for comprehensive token management

**Key Insight:** The plugin has excellent Adyen integration and all backend infrastructure needed. Adding account management interface would provide complete token management functionality matching major e-commerce platforms.
