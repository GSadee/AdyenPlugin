# 3DS2 (3D Secure 2.0) - YES

## Why This IS Supported

The plugin provides comprehensive integration with Adyen's 3D Secure service, implementing both Native and Redirect 3D Secure 2.0 authentication flows for enhanced security and PSD2 SCA compliance:

### What IS Supported (Adyen 3D Secure Integration):

1. **Complete 3D Secure 2.0 Implementation**:
   - **Native 3D Secure**: Authentication performed within the website using Adyen's drop-in component
   - **Automatic 3DS2 Enablement**: `ClientPayloadFactory.php:300` - `allow3DS2: true` for all card payments
   - **Frictionless Flow**: Background authentication using device fingerprinting without shopper interaction
   - **Challenge Flow**: Interactive authentication with biometrics or two-factor authentication when required

2. **Advanced Authentication Flows**:
   - **Payment Details Processing**: `PaymentDetailsAction.php:54` - dedicated endpoint for 3DS2 challenge responses
   - **Multi-Step Authentication**: Full support for additional authentication data during 3DS2 challenges
   - **Device Fingerprinting**: Automatic collection and transmission of device data for risk assessment
   - **Risk-Based Authentication**: Integration with Adyen's risk engine to determine authentication requirements

3. **Frontend 3D Secure Integration**:
   - **Drop-in Native Support**: Adyen's drop-in component handles all 3DS2 complexity automatically
   - **Challenge Handling**: Seamless integration of authentication challenges within checkout flow
   - **Fallback Support**: Automatic fallback to 3DS1 for legacy card issuers
   - **Mobile Compatibility**: Native support for iOS and Android 3DS2 authentication

4. **PSD2 SCA Compliance**:
   - **Strong Customer Authentication**: Full compliance with European PSD2 regulations
   - **Liability Shift Protection**: Authentication provides liability shift from merchant to issuer
   - **Authentication Engine**: Reduces regulatory complexity through Adyen's compliance automation
   - **Alternative Flows**: Support for authorization-only and data-only authentication scenarios

5. **State Management and Processing**:
   - **Multi-Step Flow Handling**: Proper management of 3DS2's multi-step authentication process
   - **Payment State Machine**: Integration with Sylius payment states for pending authentication
   - **Webhook Integration**: Real-time updates on authentication status and completion
   - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for authentication failures and timeouts

### Technical Implementation Excellence:

**3DS2 Authentication Flow:**
1. Customer initiates card payment in checkout
2. `add3DSecureFlags()` automatically enables 3DS2 for scheme payments
3. Adyen's drop-in performs device fingerprinting and risk assessment
4. If challenge required, authentication UI displayed within checkout
5. Challenge response processed via `PaymentDetailsAction` endpoint
6. Authentication result integrated with payment completion

**Risk-Based Authentication Integration:**
- **Automatic Risk Assessment**: Adyen's risk engine determines authentication requirements
- **Dynamic 3DS Triggering**: Authentication only when necessary based on risk factors
- **Frictionless When Possible**: Background authentication for low-risk transactions
- **Challenge When Required**: Interactive authentication for high-risk transactions

**Security and Compliance Benefits:**
- **PCI DSS Enhancement**: 3DS2 provides additional security layer beyond tokenization
- **Fraud Reduction**: Significant reduction in card-not-present fraud
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets PSD2 SCA requirements for European transactions
- **Liability Protection**: Shifts liability to card issuer for authenticated transactions

### Integration with Adyen's 3D Secure Service:

**Authentication Methods Supported:**
- **Passive Authentication**: Background verification using device and behavioral data
- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint, face recognition, voice recognition
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: SMS codes, mobile app notifications, hardware tokens
- **Knowledge-Based Authentication**: Passwords, PINs, security questions

**API Integration:**
- **Native Integration**: Built-in support for Adyen's Sessions flow
- **Payment API**: Uses standard `/payments` and `/payments/details` endpoints
- **Additional Data Handling**: Proper processing of 3DS2-specific parameters
- **Challenge Response**: Dedicated handling of authentication challenge responses

### Business Value and Benefits:

**Security Enhancement:**
- **Fraud Protection**: Significant reduction in unauthorized card transactions
- **Authentication Assurance**: Verified cardholder identity for transactions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Dynamic authentication based on transaction risk profile
- **Compliance Automation**: Automatic PSD2 SCA compliance without merchant complexity

**Customer Experience:**
