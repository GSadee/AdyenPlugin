### **Total Coverage: 56.8%** 
(10 fully supported + 5 partially supported × 0.5 = 12.5 out of 22 functionalities)

### Core Payment Processing Coverage: 87.5%
The plugin covers most core payment processing functionalities:
- ✅ 3DS2 authentication (PSD2 SCA compliance)
- ✅ Dynamic payment method selection
- ✅ Pre-authorization and capture workflows
- ✅ Comprehensive refund capabilities
- ✅ Enterprise-grade webhook integration
- ✅ Complete tokenization for recurring payments
- ⚠️ Application info and basic analytics tracking

### Advanced Adyen Services Coverage: 25.0%
Limited support for advanced Adyen services:
- ⚠️ Express Checkout (checkout page only, missing product/cart pages)
- ⚠️ Revenue Protect (basic fraud detection active, no advanced UI)
- ⚠️ Authorization Release (manual only, no automated rules)
- ⚠️ Network Tokens (core integration works, missing configuration convenience)
- ❌ Specialized services (Pay-by-Link, Account Updater, Auto-Rescue, ESD, Importing Tokens)

### Critical Infrastructure Issues:
- ❌ **Dependencies Updates**: Using severely outdated Adyen SDKs (PHP: 17 major versions behind, JS: 2 major versions behind) creating security, compatibility, and functionality risks requiring urgent attention

### Assessment:

The Sylius Adyen Plugin demonstrates **excellent architectural design and comprehensive core payment processing capabilities** with 56.8% overall Adyen functionality coverage, but faces **critical infrastructure challenges** that require immediate attention.

#### Core Payment Processing Excellence (87.5% Coverage)
The plugin provides enterprise-grade support for standard e-commerce payment operations:
- **Complete Security Infrastructure**: Full 3DS2 authentication, PSD2 SCA compliance, and comprehensive tokenization
- **Payment Lifecycle Management**: Pre-authorization, capture, and referenced refund workflows
- **Merchant Infrastructure**: Enterprise webhook integration, payment method selection, and transaction tracking
- **Regulatory Compliance**: All essential security and compliance features fully implemented
- **Single Core Gap**: Partial Payments missing (multi-tender checkout capability)

#### Advanced Services Foundation (25.0% Coverage)  
The plugin shows strong architectural readiness for Adyen's specialized services:
- **Partial Integration**: Express Checkout, Revenue Protect, Authorization Release, Analytics, and Network Tokens all have foundational support
- **Transparent API Design**: Architecture works seamlessly with Adyen services (demonstrated by Network Tokens working with minimal configuration)
- **Enhancement Ready**: Most advanced features require focused development rather than architectural changes

#### Critical Infrastructure Concerns
**Urgent Technical Debt**: The plugin relies on severely outdated dependencies:
- **PHP SDK**: 17 major versions behind (v11.0 vs v28.1.0) - critical security and compatibility risks
- **JavaScript SDK**: 2 major versions behind (v4.9.0 vs v6.19.0) - missing features and potential deprecation
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, API compatibility risks, missing features, and future service disruption potential

#### Key Architectural Strengths
- **Service Integration Approach**: Plugin integrates with Adyen's services rather than reimplementing functionality
- **API Transparency**: Pass-through design supports new Adyen features without major plugin changes  
- **Modular Enhancement**: Missing features can be added incrementally without disrupting core functionality
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive logging, error handling, and state management

#### Strategic Positioning
This plugin serves as an **excellent foundation for Adyen integration** with most core payment processing needs met out-of-the-box. However, **immediate dependency updates are critical** to address security and compatibility risks. The architectural design enables rapid enhancement of advanced features as business needs evolve, making it suitable for merchants requiring reliable payment processing with growth potential toward Adyen's specialized services.

**Primary Gaps**: 
1. **Critical**: Dependency updates (security and compatibility risk)
2. **Core**: Partial Payments represents the most significant missing core functionality for standard e-commerce operations
